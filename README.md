Design a class named Student and its two subclass named Undergraduate and
Postgraduate. A student has an matric, name, email and GPA. Undergraduate student

student has a thesis title. Define an appropriate constructor, set and get method for each
class. Student class has a toString method that return student matric, name, email and
GPA.

Postgraduate, and invokes their toString() methods. Example of output:
